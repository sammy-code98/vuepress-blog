# Get Started with vuepress

![post image](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/hero.png)

VuePress is composed of two parts, a minimalistic static site generator (opens new window)with a Vue-powered theming system and Plugin API, and a default theme optimized for writing technical documentation. It was created to support the documentation needs of Vue’s own sub projects.

Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Yet, once the page is loaded, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Extra pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.


## How it works

A VuePress site is in fact a SPA powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). If you’ve used Vue before, you will notice the familiar development experience when you are writing or developing custom themes (you can even use Vue DevTools to debug your custom theme!).

During the build, we create a server-rendered version of the app and render the corresponding HTML by virtually visiting each route. This approach is inspired by [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)'s  `nuxt generate` command and other projects like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).


## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-vuepress-site [optionalDirectoryName]
```

## Configuration

Without any configuration, the page is pretty minimal, and the user has no way to navigate around the site. To customize your site, let’s first create a  `.vuepress` directory inside your docs directory. This is where all VuePress-specific files will be placed. Your project structure is probably like this:

```
.
├─ docs
│  ├─ README.md
│  └─ .vuepress
│     └─ config.js
└─ package.json
```


```js
// async function is also supported, too
export default ({
  Vue, // the version of Vue being used in the VuePress app
  options, // the options for the root Vue instance
  router, // the router instance for the app
  siteData, // site metadata
  isServer // is this enhancement applied in server-rendering or client
}) => {
  // ...apply enhancements to the app
}
```
```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

``` html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="todo in todos"
    :key="todo.id"
  >
    {{ todo.text }}
  </li>
</ul>
